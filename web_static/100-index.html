								<p>Who made the world? Who made the swan, and the black
								bear? Who made the grasshopper? This grasshopper, I mean-
								the one who has flung herself out of the grass, the one who
								is eating sugar out of my hand, who is moving her jaws back
								and forth instead of up and down- who is gazing around with
								her enormous and complicated eyes. Now she lifts her pale
								forearms and thoroughly washes her face. Now she snaps her
								wings open, and floats away.</p>
							</li>
							<li><h3>From Lya Perezthe 27 november 2022</h3>
								<p>I don't know exactly what a prayer is. I do know how to
								pay attention, how to fall down into the grass, how to
								kneel down in the grass, how to be idle and blessed, how to
								stroll through the fields, which is what I have been doing
								all day. Tell me, what else should I have done? Doesn't
								everything die at last, and too soon? Tell me, what is it
								you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?</p>
